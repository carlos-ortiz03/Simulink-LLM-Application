This document outlines various test scenarios to evaluate the accuracy and helpfulness of a large language model (LLM) in conjunction with Simulink. Each scenario includes a prompt and the expected outcome from the LLM.

## 1. Automotive: Cruise Control System

**Prompt:** "Model a cruise control system for a car. The system should maintain a set speed despite changes in road incline and external forces like wind resistance."

**Expectation:** The LLM should help create a Simulink model that includes a vehicle dynamics block, a PID controller for speed regulation, and external forces acting on the vehicle.

## 2. Electrical Engineering: DC Motor Control

**Prompt:** "Model the control system for a DC motor. Include a PID controller to manage the motor speed based on a desired setpoint."

**Expectation:** The LLM should guide setting up a model with the motor's electrical and mechanical components, a PID controller, and feedback loops for speed control.

## 3. Environmental Engineering: Water Treatment Process

**Prompt:** "Model a basic water treatment process that includes filtration, sedimentation, and disinfection stages. Simulate the impact of varying contaminant levels on the treatment efficiency."

**Expectation:** The LLM should assist in creating a model with blocks representing each treatment stage and simulate the changes in water quality.

## 4. Robotics: Path Planning for a Mobile Robot

**Prompt:** "Model a path planning algorithm for a mobile robot navigating through a maze. The robot should avoid obstacles and find the shortest path to the target."

**Expectation:** The LLM should help design a model with sensors for obstacle detection, an algorithm for path planning (e.g., A\* or Dijkstra), and simulate the robot's movement.

## 5. Renewable Energy: Solar Panel System

**Prompt:** "Model a solar panel system that includes a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm to optimize energy production under varying sunlight conditions."

**Expectation:** The LLM should create a model with solar panel characteristics, an MPPT controller, and simulate the power output under different sunlight intensities.

## 6. Aerospace: Flight Control System

**Prompt:** "Model a flight control system for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system should stabilize the UAV in pitch, roll, and yaw under turbulent wind conditions."

**Expectation:** The LLM should guide setting up a model with UAV dynamics, control algorithms for stabilization, and simulate the response to wind disturbances.

## 7. Biomedical: Heart Rate Monitoring System

**Prompt:** "Model a heart rate monitoring system that uses ECG signals to determine the heart rate. Include noise filtering and signal processing stages."

**Expectation:** The LLM should assist in creating a model that processes ECG signals, filters noise, and calculates the heart rate.

## 8. Communication Systems: Signal Modulation and Demodulation

**Prompt:** "Model a communication system that includes both modulation and demodulation of a signal. Use QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) for the process."

**Expectation:** The LLM should help design a model that includes QAM modulation, transmission over a noisy channel, and demodulation at the receiver.

## 9. Mechanical Engineering: Vibrational Analysis of a Cantilever Beam

**Prompt:** "Model the vibrational response of a cantilever beam subjected to a harmonic force at the free end. Analyze the beam's natural frequencies and mode shapes."

**Expectation:** The LLM should assist in creating a model of the beam's dynamics and simulate its response to the harmonic force.

## 10. Economics: Supply and Demand Model

**Prompt:** "Model a basic supply and demand economic system. Include factors such as price elasticity, production costs, and consumer preferences."

**Expectation:** The LLM should help set up a model that simulates the interaction between supply, demand, and pricing.
